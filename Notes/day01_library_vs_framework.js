// React:
    // React is a Javascript library which is used for building single page application (jisme page refresh nahi ho).
    // React: (only focus on frontend dev)
    // Next.js is a framework of React (focuses on frontend as well as backend development)

// ex: facebook messaging example.
// gsap: css animation purely using JS.

// framework vs library
// ex: library vs college library
// framework: taking  all books and notebooks for only one class "History"
// library: only taking history book

// library is a collection of reusable blocks of code whereas framework is a collection of libraries

// library:
    // libraries are light weight
    // libraries are always particular functionality oriented 
    // using libraries, we can create fast and scalable applications
    // applications that are created using library are easy to debug.

// framework:
    // frameworks are heavy weighted
    // focus on multiple functionalites
    // compared to libraries frameworksa are more strictly typed
    // if we want any external libraries or frameworks we can install them
    // compared with libraries, frameworks are little slower.
    // applications that are created using frameworks are hard to debug.

// SPA:
    // single page applications are those applications that does not require page reload for updating the content
    // single page application will contain only one html file
    // single page applications are faster than multipage applications
    // AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And XML) is the hero of single page applications

// What is AJAX?
    // ex: Subham and pani ka bottle (everyone is going with him)
    // request reaponse cycle bahut kam rehta hai, thats why single page apps are fast.
    // AJAX will send only the necessary request to the server, so that bandwidth will be very very less
    // and because of that request response cycle becomes very very faster and ultimately your application becomes faster.
    // AJAX helps in changing the page content without page refresh.

// Package bundler?
    // will bundle all the requests into individual bundles based on the extensions
    // will help to reduce the bandwidth
    // if we are sending n no of request from the frontend that multiple requests are bundled into as minimum no of request as possible based on their extensions by the package bundler. So that bandwidth (no of request and response cycles per second) will be reduced.
    // As minimum is your bandwidth that much fast is your application
    // ex: webpack, rollup, parcel

// steps for the INSTALLATION of REACT:

    // create a folder and open cmd inside it
    // run the command: "npm create vite" and proceed
    // give name > leave package name > select framework (React) > select Javascript 
    // run: cd projectName
    // run: npm install
    // run: npm run dev
