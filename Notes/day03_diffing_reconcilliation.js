Babel: 
    - It is a transpiler. 
    - it will convert the modern JS code into browser understandable JS.
    - modern JS code means JSX code.
    - converting the JSX code into browser understandable JS code is called transpilation and it is done by Babel.
    - transpilation occurs during the rendering

// COMPONENTS:
    // components are reusable block of code that always returns jsx code.
    // the first letter of a component must be uppercase.
    // agar galti se lowercase me likhe to naya banane time change the name(uppercase, lowercase change krne se kuch nahi hoga) because it remembers the previous name
    // eg:
        // an EMPIRE 
        // where different different villages are like components and the main.jsx acts like the king,
        // only the king communicates with the foreign bodies.
